This directory contains a monitor program which supports booting Xinu
for network using BOOTP and TFTP. It is designed to be a stand alone module.
Thus, it contains its own Ethernet driver, ARP, BOOTP, TFTP, and 
a simplified version of IP and UDP.

TODO:	This version uses a queue of Ethernet buffers using buffer-pool.
	Thus, it depends on buffer-pool related routines (e.g., makepool(),
	getbuf(), freebuf(), etc.) provided in the sys directory. 
	The next task to do is to eliminate these routines and implement
	its own buffer management routines, thus making the monitor truly 
	stand alone.
